Given an integer 'n', create an array such that each value is repeated twice. For example

n = 3 --> [1,1,2,2,3,3]
n = 4 --> [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4]

After creating it, find a permutation such that each number is spaced in such a way, they are at a "their value" distance from the second occurrence of the same number.

For example: n = 3 --> This is the array - [1,1,2,2,3,3]

Your output should be [3,1,2,1,3,2]

The second 3 is 3 digits away from the first 3.
The second 2 is 2 digits away from the first 2.
The second 1 is 1 digit away from the first 1.

Return any 1 permutation if it exists. Empty array if no permutation exists.
