Given many coins of 3 different face values, print the combination sums of the coins up to 1000. Must be printed in order.

eg: coins(10, 15, 55)
print:
10
15
20
25
30

.
1000
NOTE:

- The problem could be listing all solutions to the following equations:

10X + 15Y + 55Z = N

N = 1, 2, 3, ... 1000
